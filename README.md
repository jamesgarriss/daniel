# Introduction To Daniel

## Historical Context

### Who is the author?

The author of the book is Daniel.  The book itself claims Daniel as the author (8:1, 9:2, 9:20-22, 10:2).  Jesus asserted that Daniel was the author in Mt 24:15 when he said, “When you see the abomination that causes desolation, spoken of by the prophet Daniel” (HCSB) (see also Mk 13:14).   This is a reference to Daniel 9:27.  Ezekiel, a contemporary of Daniel, mentioned Daniel’s righteousness and wisdom (Ezk 14:14, 20, 28:3).

Daniel is referred to in New Testament prophetic passages more than any other Old Testament book, and it has more prophecies that have come to pass than any other book in the Bible.[4] 

### What historical situation occasioned this writing?

God chose the nation of Israel as his means for bringing about his redemptive plan for mankind.  He covenanted to be the God of Israel but required them to live holy lives.  Too often they did not.  They were immoral and idol worshippers, so after many warnings God judged them.  First, the Assyrian Empire conquered the Northern Kingdom of Israel.  Then, the Babylonian Empire conquered the Southern Kingdom of Israel.  Jerusalem was sacked; the temple was destroyed; and the nation was exiled.

In the midst of the exile, God revealed his sovereignty to his people.  He powerfully demonstrated that even worldwide rulers like Nebuchadnezzar served at his word and were subject to his authority.  God still had a plan for his people, and even Babylonian exile could not thwart it.

There are several dates of interest:

*	722 B.C. Fall of Northern Kingdom
*	612 B.C. Fall of Nineveh, end of the Assyrian Empire, rise of the Babylonian Empire
*	605 B.C. Battle of Carchemish, coronation of Nebuchadnezzar, Egypt and Judah’s defeat by Nebuchadnezzar, attack on Jerusalem, deportation of Daniel and his friends
*	597 B.C. Rebellion of Jehoiachin, subjection of Jerusalem, deportation of 10,000 Jewish captives including Ezekiel
*	587 B.C. Fall of Jerusalem and the Southern Kingdom, destruction of the temple, deportation of most remaining Jews
*	562 B.C. Death of Nebuchadnezzar
*	539 B.C. Fall of Babylon, end of the Babylonian Empire, rise of the Persian Empire
*	538 B.C. Initial return of Jewish exiles
*	530 B.C. Writing of the book of Daniel (approximate)
*	515 B.C. Completion of the rebuilt temple
	
### When was the book written?

The narrative covers a broad period of time, from Daniel’s capture by Nebuchadnezzar in 605 B.C. (1:1) to the third year of the reign of Cyrus in 535 B.C. (10:1).  Daniel probably wrote the book a few years after that, perhaps around 530 B.C.

Liberal scholars who reject supernatural prophecy date the book to the 3rd century B.C., suggesting that it was written during the Maccabean revolt to encourage the Hebrews in their fight against Antiochus IV.  This was first proposed by Porphyrius of Tyre in the 3rd century B.C. and picked up again by J.D. Michaelis and others in the 18th century.[1]

## Who are the recipients?

The recipients are the Jewish people whose homeland was sacked by Nebuchadnezzar.  Some have been exiled in Babylon, where “they had to face the problems both of settling down in an alien land, dominated by a pagan religion, and also of remaining faithful to the God of their fathers, even though they had no temple and no sacrificial ritual.”   After Cyrus the Persia ascended the throne, some returned to Judah.  They were faced with the tasking of rebuilding Jerusalem, the temple, and their rest of their homeland.

## What is the author’s purpose?

This book was written to give hope and confidence to the nation of Israel while they were in the midst of difficult times, both during the exile and the start of the return.  It was “a message of encouragement [and] wise counsel, especially through its assurance that God had control and foreknowledge of the forces that seemed to dominate human history.” 

## What genre of literature is this?

The Hebrew Bible places Daniel among the Writings; the Greek and English versions place it among the Prophets.  This difference illustrates the difficulty of identifying the genre of Daniel in simple terms.

It is prophetic literature in the sense that Daniel is concerned with what every prophet is concerned with:  God’s plan for Israel despite her sins.  It is wisdom literature in the sense that Daniel’s exemplary life in Babylon demonstrates a life of wisdom and dependence upon God.  It is apocalyptic literature in that it records visions from God concerning the future through many signs, symbols, and numbers. 

The book is written in two different languages.  Chapters 1 and 8-12 are written in Hebrew; chapters 2-7 in Aramaic.  Aramaic was the official language of the Persian Empire and the international language of the day.  The Hebrew chapters deal with Jewish concerns and God’s plan for his covenant people; the Aramaic chapters deal with all people in the Babylonian and Persian empires.   The Aramaic chapters may have been published separately for non-Jews. 

The book of Daniel, though historical, is not consistently chronological.  The visions of the latter chapters cover some of the same time periods as the narratives of the earlier chapters. 

## Primary Theme

The primary theme of the book is that God is absolutely sovereign.  “The fortunes of kings and the affairs of men are subject to God’s decrees...he is able to accomplish his will despite the most determined opposition of the mightiest potentates on earth.”
